# Durable Functions Use Cases

In this repository, I'll collect some real-life challenges you can solve using Azure Functions & Durable Functions.

These challenges do assume some experience with Azure Functions (in .NET) and a basic understanding of Durable Functions. If you want to learn more about those first, then please visit [Azure Functions University](https://github.com/marcduiker/azure-functions-university).

## 1. [Notify Support](/lessons/notifysupport.md)
