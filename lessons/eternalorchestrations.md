# Eternal Orchestrations

Eternal orchestrators are orchestrators that never finish. They are useful when you want to perform a workflow in a loop.

```csharp
```

You can make a conditional eternal orchestrator that only continues the orchestrator inside an `if statement` based on logic you provide (e.g. a result of an activity, sub-orchestrator, or event).
