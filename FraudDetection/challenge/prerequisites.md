## Creating your local workspace üë©‚Äçüíª

Create a new folder (local git repository) and use the repository you're currently reading from for reference only (for when you're stuck).

- Create a new folder to work in:

    ```cmd
    C:\dev\mkdir fraud-detection
    C:\dev\cd .\fraud-detection\
    ```

- Turn this into a git repository:

    ```cmd
    C:\dev\fraud-detection\git init
    ```

- Add subfolders for the source code and test files:

    ```cmd
    C:\dev\fraud-detection\mkdir src
    C:\dev\fraud-detection\mkdir tst
    ```

You should be good to go now!
